C&amp;DH Team's work for 2021-2022

Please read the "CuSAT-CDH-DESG-001-ENV_SETUP_GUIDE.pdf" to get up and running with the 
Demo code we made in the 2021-2022 year.

It will show you how to get setup with a modern version of eclipse and the steps
required to run our code on the iOBC with 3 labs outlined for you to try.

Find the file "CuSAT-CDH-DESG-001.docx" for the version you can edit and update.
