The zip file included "isis-iobc-hal-0.2.4" is superseded by the GitHub Repository Demo code.
Included in the repository from 2021-2022 is all the original HAL demo code plus additions, including CSP source code, and our custom 
experimental demo code. It should be configured to work and compile if the Environment Setup Guide is followed.

You may use "isis-obc-first-project" as your first learning project to interface and run code on the iOBC if you wish.
